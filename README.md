Inferno is a library that simplifies the process of working with JSON data. It allows users to automatically infer data types from a JSON file and generate a parser that can parse it. This eliminates the need for users to manually specify data types and write custom parsing logic, saving time and reducing the potential for error.

Using Inferno is simple: just provide the JSON file and let Inferno do the rest. It will analyze the data and generate a parser that is optimized for the specific structure of the JSON file. The generated parser can then be used to easily and efficiently access and manipulate the data in the JSON file.

So why settle for dull and boring JSON parsing when you can add a little heat with Inferno? Give it a try and let the flames of productivity engulf you!
